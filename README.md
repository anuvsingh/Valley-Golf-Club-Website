# Valley Family Golf Website

A visually engaging, interactive website for Sidcup Family Golf â€“ a Toptracer driving range and crazy golf venue located in Sidcup, South East London. This project showcases modern web development techniques including responsive design, advanced CSS animations, and JavaScript-powered interactions using the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library.

## Overview

The website is designed to capture the fun and energetic spirit of Sidcup Family Golf. It includes:
- A full-screen video background on the homepage.
- An interactive custom cursor that reacts to mouse movements and hover states.
- Dynamic scroll-triggered animations that enhance user engagement.
- A multi-section layout highlighting services such as the Toptracer Range, Golf Lessons, Adventure Golf, Coffee Shop, and Leagues.

## Features

- **Custom Navigation Bar:**  
  A fixed navigation bar that adjusts its styling (e.g., background color and height) on scroll.

- **Custom Cursor & Blur Effect:**  
  A unique cursor element that follows the mouse movement, with a blurred background effect for added visual interest. When hovering over navigation links, the cursor scales up and changes style.

- **Video Background:**  
  The homepage features a muted, looping video background that helps set the atmosphere.

- **Scrolling Text & Animations:**  
  A continuously scrolling text marquee implemented with CSS keyframes, plus GSAP animations to animate elements on scroll (e.g., images, text sections, and overlay effects).

  The services section displays cards that reveal more information on hover with smooth overlay animations and a subtle 3D rotation effect.
